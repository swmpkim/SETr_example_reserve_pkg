# SETr Example Reserve Package  

This is a full example, using Grand Bay NERR's data, of the workflow and outputs provided to each of the 15 participating Reserves as part of the NERRS Science Collaborative-funded project "Is marsh surface tracking sea level change? Developing tools and visualizations for NERRS Sentinel Site Data". **If you want to work with this example, first be sure to read the [SETr Workflow Guide](https://drive.google.com/open?id=14CslEIyoVDuR1q_Nlmt9d87UJnCQvsHV) (pdf; opens in google drive).**
