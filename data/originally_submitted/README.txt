This folder contains the originally submitted data and metadata for the SETr project.
Unless noted, the excel files have not been changed directly;
the only changes were made using R, to reshape the data into a standardized format.

The R script(s) that made these changes are also in this folder. If any manual changes were required,
they are documented in the scripts.

The scripts used a development version of the `tidyr` packages; the pivot_longer and pivot_wider functions had not been completely developed and the way some operations were done may be slightly different now.
However, these are still a valuable record of the steps that were taken to move data from its original format into the SETr "raw" data format.
